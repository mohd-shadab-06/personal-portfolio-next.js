# What are Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React's features, such as state management, lifecycle methods, and context, without writing a class. The two most commonly used hooks are:

1 - useState - For managing state.

2 - useEffect - For handling side effects (like fetching data, subscriptions, etc.).

## Rules of Hooks

Call Hooks at the Top Level: Donâ€™t call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Always call them at the top level of your React function.

Call Hooks Only in React Functions: You can use hooks only inside functional components or custom hooks.

#Core Hooks

## 1. UseState

Manages local state in a functional component.

useState takes an initial state as an argument and returns an array with two elements: 1 - The current state. 2 - A function to update the state.

<CodeWindow title="useState.jsx">

```TSX
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</CodeWindow>
